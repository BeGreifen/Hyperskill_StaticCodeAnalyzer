<p>Alice has a file called <strong>"books.txt" </strong>with all the books that she needs to read for her class. Her professor added another book to the list, so Alice wants to add a new line to the file. Below you can see her code.</p>
<p>However, Alice made a mistake and got a result which was absolutely not what she had expected. Can you fix her mistake?</p>
<p>Don't worry about closing the file here, it will be done under the hood.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
